<img src= "assets/image/Screenshot 2022-01-27 at 10.14.19.png"

<p1>This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors project. For people who want to settle and argument on who chooses what to watch tonight or where to go for dinner. This is a fun easy way to decide against the computer. It is a bit of fun but also shows basic functions of what can be done on JavaScript.</p1>
  
<p2>This is a responsive JavaScript game that will show the player what they have chosen as well as the randomly generated computers choice to decide a winner in the outcome section.</p2>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p3>This webiste is broken down into 3 sections which are well divided for user benefit.</p3>

<h3>Existing Features</h3>

<h4>The Rock, Paper, Scissors Heading</h4>

<p1>The heading for this site is very prominent and easy to read over the chosen background color. It is a simple title which immedietly tells the user what to expect.</p1>

<h4>The Buttons</h4>

<p1>The Button are is very easily identified to tell what each option is using a sleek FontAwesome icon choice and placed in a circular button. It is a very minimalist design.</p1>

<h4>The Scoreboard</h4>

<p1>Finally there is a very simple score area. This shows what the computer has randomly generated as an answer and also what your choice was. Below these is the Outcome which shows if you or the computer has won.</p1>

<h4>Additional Future changes</h4>

<p1>I would like to add the future change of a score counter to the game.<p1>

  <h4>Unfixed Bugs</h4>
  
  <p1>There are a few bug in this website. The game works fine on some rounds but others it comes up as undefined and the player pick won't show. I have looked over the code but due to running out of time in order to figure out where I've gone wrong I have been unable to fix the bug. I have also been unable to complete 'git pushes' while writing this as it keeps rejecting it suddenly and i dont't have time left to fix it.</p>
  
  <h4>Credits</h4>
  
  I had help with writing and laying out the readme.md section from the template from CI.
  I also sourced from websites to help with my game and figuring out the logistics of the Javascript from: https://junilearning.com/blog/coding-projects/rock-paper-scissors-java-project/ and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyqMglmrido.
  
  <h4>Media</h4>
  
  <p1>I have a different font which I sourced from Google Fonts.</p1>
  <p1>I also have Icons from FontAwesome which make up the buttons in my project</p1>
  <p1>I have no images in my project</p>
